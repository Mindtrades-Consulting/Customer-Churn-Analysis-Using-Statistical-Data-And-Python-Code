# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Using-Statistical-Data-And-Python-Code
Every company at some point evaluates the churn analysis to understand the company's customer loss rate. With all the research, the company then reduces the customer attrition rate by assessing their product and how customers use it
# Data Sources
You can find the dataset at [https://www.kaggle.com/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction]
# Data Analysis
Based on the dataset, there are 5360 observations. The churn column also shows whether a customer has been churned or not.  In conclusion, the target variable is churn, and all other columns become feature variables.
After the column description and the number of observations are established, let's study the dataset.
# Conclusion 
We analyze the data from an e-commerce website. We saw how we could engineer features for our purposes. We filled the missing values by using the most straightforward method. However, this should be considered to know precisely how missing values can be filled. 

The dataset is primarily missing age and duration, which are critical pieces of information. If we look at the market, e-commerce is a relatively new business model and aged people are not on it. This makes it all the more important to know the customer's age as they leave the website. If we had the age group, we would probably create clusters of data using the K-Means algorithm.

Similarly, duration is also an important factor. Knowing how long people browse an e-commerce website can shed light on the quality of service. Duration and Reason for Churn are connected to each other. The reason for churn can help an e-commerce website focus on where to improve. Having the information about the duration of the engagement can reveal if people are leaving the website quickly or not. Many businesses are opening up based on this model. Hence duration can help identify where people spend the most time and if they are loyal to the brand.
